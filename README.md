### Who am I

Polyglot backend developer with experience in infrastructure. Comfortable with **Ruby, Python and Typescript**, also worked with **.Net, Java, Javascript, Node.js**. Excited about **Elixir** and **infrastructure as code**. Currently working on AWS Certified Developer - Associate Level certification. I enjoy working with **well tested and structured code**. Interested in adopting the ways of working inspired by practices of highly performing IT organisations. I like to think of myself as an enthusiastic person that cares about the team and delivering The Right Thing.

## My skills

**Learning**
I have a curious mind and I think learning is the single most important skill as a programmer. I think the best way to learn is to learn through doing and  teaching - I have co-facilitated a workshop at Pydata London 2019 and Pydata New York 2019 about Natural Language Processing. Based on workshops and conferences I have attended, I have started picking up Elixir. I love learning about human nature through playing, so let's play board games.

**Leadership**
I have co-organized hands on Continous Integration and Continous Delivery workshops on the principles behind CI/CD and different continous integration servers for developers. About 80 people participated in about 6 iterations. On my own initiative I re-wrote a script so that 5 teams working on a particular service can create a small world for an application and run it locally. Thanks to my 6th sense, I can lead you to cookies.

**Communication**
Because I care about our communication and learning across teams and across project, I regularly speak at cross team tech time and showcases to senior stakeholders. I have run and presented at biweekly Show and Tell meetings in my previous position. It gave team members of all positions the opportunity to talk about their work and share their experiences. In my latest job when  I run a series of remote first Ways of Working workshops for our distributed team. Good communication and clear vision. Now, has anyone seen my glasses?

**Agile methodology**
I am keen to either pair program or work independently in self-organised teams. To facilitate flow of work we run daily stand ups and bi-weekly retros. I haved worked both within Kanban and Scrum framework. It's important that each team member contributes to discussions that lead to effective decision making. Nod, nod.

**TDD**
Start with a test. I will make that test pass.

**Problem Solving**
If you're reading this chances are you're looking for a developer. I'm a great developer (or at least a funny one, I'll let you decide that). There, problem solved. I rest my case.
