### Who I am?

Graduate Node.js & Rails developer looking to grow and learn. I'm comfortable with **Ruby**, **Javascript**, **HTML** and basics of **CSS**. Currently learning **Clojure(Script)** and working on my project - a node.js web-app for sharing social experiences to break the cultural iceberg. Interested in good organisation of work, especially Theory of Constraints and effective ways to communicate via Non-Violent Communication.
