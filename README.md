## Agata Sumowska

### Who am I

**Ruby and Javascript** developer looking to grow and learn. Excited about learning **Elixir** and **functional programming**. I'm comfortable with **Python**, **React**, **Redux** and basics of **C#**. Interested in continous improvement of ways of working and efficient communication, also using Non-Violent Communication techniques. In my next position I'd like to be both **supported** and **challenged**. I like to think of myself as an enthusiastic person that improves the mood of people around me.

## My skills

**Learning**
I have a curious mind and I like to make informed decisions, I think learning is the single most important skill as a programmer. Based on workshops and conferences I have attended, I have started picking up Elixir, and using AWS serveless architecture at work.

**Leadership**
To bring the best practices to our organisation, I have coorganized Continous Integration and Continous Delivery workshops for Product owners. I have also been put forward for my involvement in empowering underrepresented groups. At my course in Makers, both the practice project and the final project I worked on were my ideas brought to life by my passionate presentations at brainstorming sessions and clear vision. Now, did anyone see my glasses?

**Agile methodology**
Both at Lexis Nexis and at Makers Academy, we either paired or worked in self-organised teams. To facilitate flow of work organisation we had stand ups and retros. Great, focused discussions led to effective decision making, and each team member contributed. Nod, nod.

**Lean start up methodology**
Fail quick, not big. Invite me for an interview, give me a test. There is more to 'Lean start up' you say? Great, the test has started already.

**TDD**
Start with a test. I will make that test pass.

**Problem Solving**
If you're reading this chances are you're looking for a junior developer. I'm a great junior developer (or at least a funny one, I'll let you decide that). There, problem solved. I rest my case.
