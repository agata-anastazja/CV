### Who am I

Polyglot developer looking to grow and learn. Comfortable with **Ruby, Python and Javascript**, also worked with **.Net, Java and Typescript**. Excited about **Elixir** and **infrastructure as code**. Currently working on AWS Certified Developer - Associate Level certification. I enjoy working with **well tested and structured code**. Interested in adopting the ways of working inspired by practices of highly performing IT organisations. I like to think of myself as an enthusiastic person that cares about the team and delivering iteratively.

## My skills

**Learning**
I have a curious mind and I think learning is the single most important skill as a programmer. I think the best way to learn is to learn through doing and  teaching - I have co-facilitated a workshop at Pydata London 2019 and Pydata New York 2020 about Natural Language Processing. Based on workshops and conferences I have attended, I have started picking up Elixir. 

**Leadership**
I have co-organized hands on Continous Integration and Continous Delivery workshops on the principles behind CI/CD and different continous integration servers for developers. About 80 people participated in about 6 iterations. On my own initiative I re-wrote a script so that 5 teams working on a particular service can create a small world for an application and run it locally. Thanks to my 6th sense, I can lead you to cookies.

**Communication**
Because I care about our communication and learning across teams, I regularly speak at cross team tech time and showcases. I have run and presented at biweekly Show and Tell meetings in my previous position. It gave team members of all positions the opportunity to talk about their work and share their experiences. In my latest job when I realised there were unmet expectations for what each role in team involved I run a series of remote first Ways of Working workshops for our distributed team. Good communication and clear vision. Now, has anyone seen my glasses?

**Agile methodology**
I am keen to either pair program or work independently in self-organised teams. To facilitate flow of work we run daily stand ups and bi-weekly retros. I haved worked both within Kanban and Scrum framework. It's important that each team member contributes to discussions that lead to effective decision making. Nod, nod.

**TDD**
Start with a test. I will make that test pass.

**Problem Solving**
If you're reading this chances are you're looking for a developer. I'm a great developer (or at least a funny one, I'll let you decide that). There, problem solved. I rest my case.

## Experience

January 2019 - Now Thoughtworks
Java, Openshift, React + Redux

March 2017 - November 2018 Lexis Nexis
C#, Python, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Dynamo DB, React + Redux


## Projects I worked on 

**Large scale distributed system**

We wrote it, we run it 

Understanding and maintanence (new features balanced with a fair amount of bugs and production fixes) of a complex distributed system that brings on average 2 million pounds profit daily 
Writing infrastructure as code 
Releasing to production regularly, writing infrastructure as code for handling secrets management  

**Datalake**

Part of team building a datalake following Serverless Architecture and Event sourcing patterns. We are writing AWS Lambda functions in Python invoked via API Gateway set up using Cloudformation templates.

**Interactive forms**

In my previous team within Lexis Nexis we worked on building forms for computing legal fees of all sorts, using React with Redux and C# in the back end.

**Tech radar**

When our company decided to get more visibility on what stacks we were using across the organisation, I volunteered to modify Tech radar used by Thoughtworks for our needs.
