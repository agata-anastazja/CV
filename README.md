### Who am I

**Ruby and Javascript** developer looking to grow and learn. Excited about **Elixir** and **infrastructure as code**. I enjoy using **Python**, **React**, **Redux** and working with **well tested and structured code**. Interested in adopting the ways of working inspired by practices of highly performing IT organisations. In my next position I'd like to be both **challenged** and **supported**. I like to think of myself as an enthusiastic person that cares about the team and delivering iteratively.

## My skills

**Learning**
I have a curious mind and I think learning is the single most important skill as a programmer. Based on workshops and conferences I have attended, I have started picking up Elixir. I think the best way to learn is to learn through doing, so after listening about using serveless architecture at AWS Builder day I joined a team using this approach.

**Leadership**
I have co-organized hands on Continous Integration and Continous Delivery workshops for developers. About 80 people participated in about 6 iterations. I have also been put forward for my involvement in empowering underrepresented groups. Thanks to my 6th sense, I can lead you to cookies.

**Communication**
Because I care about our teams communicating better, I run and sometimes present at biweekly Show and Tell meetings. It gives team members of all positions and background the opportunity to talk about their work and share their learnings. It's where our product people get an overview of projects they have not worked with, their current state and direction. Good communication and clear vision. Now, did anyone see my glasses?

**Agile methodology**
I am keen to either pair program or worked independently in self-organised teams. To facilitate flow of work we run daily stand ups and weekly retros. Focused discussions lead to effective decision making, and each team member contributes. Nod, nod.

**TDD**
Start with a test. I will make that test pass.

**Problem Solving**
If you're reading this chances are you're looking for a developer. I'm a great developer (or at least a funny one, I'll let you decide that). There, problem solved. I rest my case.

## Experience

 March 2017 - now Lexis Nexis
 C#, Python, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Dynamo DB, React + Redux

## Projects I worked on at Lexis Nexis

**Datalake**

I am part of a team building a datalake following Serverless Architecture and Event sourcing patterns. We are writing AWS Lambda functions in Python invoked via API Gateway set up using Cloudformation templates.

**Interactive forms**

In my previous team within Lexis Nexis we worked on building forms for computing legal fees of all sorts, using React with Redux and C# in the back end.

**Tech radar**

When our company decided to get more visibility on what stacks we were using across the organisation, I volunteered to modify Tech radar used by Thoughtworks for our needs.
