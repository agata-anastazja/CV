## Agata Sumowska

### Who am I

Node.js & Rails developer looking to grow and learn. I'm comfortable with **Ruby**, **Javascript**, **HTML** and basics of **CSS**. Currently learning **Clojure(Script)** and working on my project - a node.js web-app for sharing social experiences to break the cultural iceberg. Interested in good organisation of work, especially Theory of Constraints and effective ways to communicate, also using Non-Violent Communication techniques. In my first position I'd like to be both **supported** and **challenged**. I like to think of myself as a **cheerful** person that improves the mood of people around me.

## My skills

**Learning**
I have a curious mind and I like to make informed decisions, I think learning is the single most important skill as a programmer. So on top of Ruby, Rails and Javascript, I decided to pick up new languages and frameworks: Clojure and Node.js in which I had a working knowledge within a 5 days. 

**Leadership**
Both the practice project and the final project I worked on were my ideas brought to life by my short presentations at brainstorming sessions and excellent, clear vision. Now, did anyone see my glasses?

**Agile methodology**
While at Makers Academy, we either paired or worked in self-organised teams, so to facilitate organisation had stand ups and retros. Great, focused discussions led to effective decision making, and each team member contributed. Nod, nod.

**Lean start up methodology**
Fail quick, not big. Invite me for an interview, give me a test. There is more to 'Lean start up' you say? Great, the test has started already.

**TDD**
Start with a test. I will make that test pass.

**Problem Solving**
If you're reading this chances are you're looking for a junior developer. I'm a great junior developer (or at least a funny one, I'll let you decide that). There, problem solved. I rest my case.
